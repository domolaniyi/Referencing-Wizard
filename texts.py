              "recent studies that focuses on the applications of different renewable energy systems with " \
              "thermoelectric generators. The paper is divided as follows: Section 2 describes the development and " \
              "working principle of thermoelectric generators. Section 3 presents the performance of TEGs when " \
              "integrated with several renewable energy systems and Section 4 will be dedicated to conclusions and " \
              "future perspectives. Thermoelectric technology is one of many green technologies which is able to " \
              "convert heat into electricity and vice versa. Seebeck effect which goes back to 1821 and is based on " \
              "potential generation across a certain load due to temperature difference between two junctions (hot " \
              "and cold) is the fundamental concept for a thermoelectric generator. Until 1990s, thermoelectric " \
              "devices were uncommonly used due to their low processing efficiency. However, renewed interest in " \
              "thermoelectric devices has been introduced into research due to global warming alerts and the need of " \
              "a sustainable, durable and reliable electric source [23], [24]. There are many types of thermoelectric " \
              "materials that can be classified based on their thermal and electrical conductivities as well as " \
              "Seebeck coefficient such as BaUO3, CoSb3, SnSe, and many others. However, Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) " \
              "is the most commonly used one due to its high effectiveness at room temperature. The working principle " \
              "of a thermoelectric device can be either as a power generator or as a thermoelectric cooler. These " \
              "devices consist of flat arrays of P (charged holes h) and (charged e) types that are connected " \
              "electrically in series and thermally operating in parallel. As a power generator, the temperature " \
              "difference causes the movement of both electrons and holes from the hot side to the cold side " \
              "resulting in a potential difference that will drive current through the device when it is connected to " \
              "an external load (see Fig. 2). The temperature gradient between the two junctions of a thermoelectric " \
              "device directly affects the output power which can be increased by the increase of this gradient and " \
              "the efficiency of the device. The efficiency of a thermoelectric generator is given as the ratio of " \
              "the power supplied to the external load by the heat absorbed at the hot junction [25], [26], [27], " \
              "[28]. Thermoelectric cooler works opposite to thermoelectric generator using Peltier effect. In this " \
              "case a direct current passing through the two junctions can produce or absorb heat based on the " \
              "direction of the current as shown in Fig. 3. This type is highly recommended upon controlling the " \
              "temperature of a certain device or system however it is quite dependent on many parameters such as " \
              "ambient temperature, thermoelectric properties and the current flow. Due to their ability to convert " \
              "low amount of heat into electricity, optimizing a thermoelectric material in order to reach the best " \
              "performance is crucial and highly dependent on the type of the material used. The performance of the " \
              "TE device is estimated depending on its operating temperature and the figure of merit (ZT). Figure of " \
              "merit depends on the seebeck effect, the thermal and electrical conductivity. Thus, improving the " \
              "figure of merit and decreasing the thermal conductivity of a thermoelectric material can significantly " \
              "enhance its performance [29], [30], [31], [32]. "

              "testing fundamental physical questions beyond the capabilities of ground-based experiments, " \
              "this review aims to embody a useful compendium for both the non-initiated and the expert reader. The " \
              "paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the application of quantum technologies in " \
              "space to fundamental physics studies: from the interface between gravity and quantum mechanics to " \
              "quantum foundations, from the detection of gravitational waves to searches for dark matter and dark " \
              "energy. We focus on the advantages provided to such quests by a space-based environment and describe " \
              "the technological platforms that have been proposed to perform them so far. In Section 3 we discuss " \
              "new applications of current quantum technologies for the assessment of fundamental-physics tests. We " \
              "address the long sight-lines and reduced losses (compared with fibre-based arrangements) of free-space " \
              "optical transmission lines, which are the driving forces for satellite-based quantum-communication " \
              "applications. We discuss how the vantage point of low Earth orbit is valuable for remote sensing and " \
              "remote observation and then tackle space-based quantum clocks for distributed time-reference frames " \
              "and synchronization towards enhanced global systems for navigation. In Section 4 we delve into " \
              "state-of-the-art proof-of-principle quantum experiments and implementations of quantum technologies in " \
              "space that have been performed to date. Section 5 highlights the technical hurdles that should be " \
              "faced to mature technology for space applications. Due to a wealth of prototyping activities – led by " \
              "the cold-atom and photonics community – many of such challenges are no longer insurmountable. We " \
              "describe how to build upon already interconnected scientific and industrial communities and which " \
              "steps are needed to enable further cross-disciplinary networks and collaborations. Expanding the " \
              "diversity of quantum experiments being performed in the promising conditions of reduced environmental " \
              "effects and micro-gravity has clear benefits for the advances of fundamental understanding and " \
              "technological developments. We provide a technical wish-list detailing the steps forward that should " \
              "be made to enable space-based experiments with quantum systems. Section 6 puts forward a realistic " \
              "outlook for the problems tackled in this review. Space offers the ideal environment to fully employ " \
              "the potential of quantum platforms and challenge some of the most fundamental open problems in modern " \
              "physics (see Fig. 1). Recently, many proposals for space-based fundamental physics tests resorting to " \
              "the possibilities offered by quantum mechanics have appeared driven by incredible technological " \
              "advancements in different areas of physics. In this section, we review the plethora of different " \
              "fundamental questions which can be addressed by combining space science and quantum technologies. We " \
              "will focus on the advantages in performing fundamental tests in space, with respect to analogous " \
              "ground-based ones, and on which platforms have been proposed to perform them. "

              "applicants and with appropriate housing solutions based on their financial capability and existing " \
              "developmental housing program [10]. Adopting enabling approach can enhance the capacity of the private " \
              "sector to provide housing for a large segment of low-income groups as well as middle- and " \
              "higher-income groups [11]. The Saudi government is thus implementing an enabling approach based on the " \
              "idea that works in developed countries such as the UK [12], the USA, Canada, and Australia [13]. " \
              "However, the implementing the approach in KSA has been criticized in several studies. For example, " \
              "it does not consider the affordability of low-income people that cannot afford housing in the existing " \
              "market, and directly threatens the main objective of housing provision, which is poverty alleviation [" \
              "14]. Another study concluded that housing provision through market mechanisms is likely to be " \
              "inconsistent and may require seeming policy contradictions [15]. It has been five years since the " \
              "launch of the enabling program, but no study investigated whether the initiatives are enhancing access " \
              "to affordable housing in the country. Hence, this study aims to assess the extent to which this " \
              "approach tackles the challenge of affordable housing in the country. According to Kavishe et al. [16], " \
              "different countries have experienced varied outcomes, with most of them experiencing failures in their " \
              "partnerships with housing market actors. In the words of Hassan [14, p.422], “many governments around " \
              "the world have adopted the enabling approach; some with more success than others”. There is a dearth " \
              "of studies on the role of the enabling approach in improving access to affordable housing in " \
              "developing countries, as only a few countries have implemented this approach. In Kolkata, India, " \
              "partnerships with market actors were challenged by a lack of access to finance, especially for low " \
              "income people, which conflicted with the partnerships’ goal of delivering affordable housing to those " \
              "in need [17]. In Lagos, Nigeria, Ibem [18] found that the enabling approach provided affordable " \
              "serviced plots and housing units for high-income groups but contributed slightly to the needs of " \
              "low-income people. Conversely, the enabling approach is successful in Malaysia where the private " \
              "sector’s performance in housing has been impressive in terms of the number of housing units completed " \
              "[19]. The private sector accounts for over 90% of housing provision and a greater proportion of " \
              "low-cost housing [20]. Thus, the successes and failures of the enabling approach is country specific. " \

              "17]. In order to realize the prospective payoffs of ECC in energy-saving and performance improvement " \
              "for SMDs, in this paper, we focus on optimal multi-user offloading problem in an ECC system, " \
              "in which there are two key issues to be addressed: How can an SMD choose optimal ECN and offload " \
              "resource-intensive computations to the chosen ECN when the constraint of mobility, " \
              "which is characterized by application completion deadline and connection time between SMDs and ECNs, " \
              "is enforced? How can an ECC system allocate ECN resources optimally to minimize total application " \
              "execution cost for multiple users with limited resources of ECNs and SMDs? This paper aims to provide " \
              "an optimal multi-user computation offloading policy to minimize the total application execution cost " \
              "of SMDs in the ECC system. First, we formulate the problem of SMD computation offloading and ECN " \
              "resource allocation into the total execution cost minimization problem of SMDs. We measure the " \
              "execution cost in terms of application execution time or energy consumption, under the constraints of " \
              "limited connection time between SMDs and ECNs, application completion deadline and limited resources " \
              "of ECNs. Second, we decompose the total execution cost minimization problem into two sub-problems. The " \
              "first sub-problem is how to obtain optimal offloading policy of SMDs. The second sub-problem is how to " \
              "achieve the optimal ECN resource allocation policy. Finally, we present the maximizing SMD offloading " \
              "payoff (MSOP) algorithm based on the game model by solving the first sub-problem. Furthermore, " \
              "we propose the multi-user payoff competition (MUPC) algorithm by solving the second sub-problem. " \
              "Different from previous offloading works [6], [18], [19], [20], [21], we leverage device mobility " \
              "under ECN resource limitation to achieve optimal multi-user offloading. Our works in this paper have " \
              "the potential benefit for many application scenarios under device mobility constraint and resource " \
              "limitation constraint, such as autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) in the edge network, " \
              "augmented reality mobile application, industrial automation. The contributions of our work can be " \
              "summarized as follows. We consider the minimum connection time between SMDs and ECNs based on their " \
              "mobility to ensure that the offloading process is feasible. The offloading problem is solved in a real " \
              "mobile scenario. We provide an optimal computation offloading policy for the single user by the MSOP " \
              "algorithm based on the game model. In the case of multiple users, the proposed MUPC algorithm can " \
              "obtain the minimum total application execution cost as well as optimal ECN resource " \
              "allocation.Experimental results show that compared to existing algorithms, our algorithms can " \
              "significantly save the total energy consumption and reduce the total application execution time of " \
              "SMDs in the ECC environment.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews some " \
              "related work. In Section 3, we present the system model and formulate the total cost minimization " \
              "problem. In Section 4, we propose the MSOP algorithm to obtain optimal offloading policy and present " \
              "the MUPC algorithm to allocate ECN resources. Section 5 gives the performance evaluation of the " \
              "proposed algorithms. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper. "

              "media (Mihunov et al., 2020; ). Several studies have shown that social media information can be " \
              "valuable for numerous humanitarian responsibilities such as “situational awareness” (Austmann & Vigne, " \
              "2021). During natural catastrophes, a large quantity of information published on Twitter is not " \
              "accessible by conventional media platforms, such as newspapers and TV (Du et al., 2019). These results " \
              "suggest that utilizing social media users as sensors throughout disasters has the potential to " \
              "facilitate effective response, reduce losses, and increase risk reduction (Pourebrahim et al., " \
              "2019). Although information posted by users may be valuable for response organizations, " \
              "a proper understanding of it in time-critical situations is complicated ( Karimiziarani, 2022, " \
              "Alipour et al., 2022). Interpretation of thousands of social media messages, for example, " \
              "is impractical because of the large volume and velocity of social media data streams (Arpaci et al., " \
              "2020). Twitter has become a popular platform for investigating public sentiments on many important " \
              "issues such as climate change. Studies have found that Twitter users who identify as conservative are " \
              "more likely to express skepticism about the existence and causes of climate change, while those who " \
              "identify as liberal are more likely to express concern and support for climate action(Lewandowsky et " \
              "al., 2019). In addition, research has shown that media coverage can shape public sentiments about " \
              "climate change. For example, exposure to media messages about the negative consequences of climate " \
              "change is associated with increased concern about the issue (Wei et al., 2021). Other studies have " \
              "focused on the role of social media in the dissemination of climate change information. Pearce et al. " \
              "(2019) found that Twitter is an important platform for the dissemination of climate change " \
              "information, with hashtags related to the issue trending frequently. Similarly, (Bain et al., " \
              "2016) found that social media platforms, such as Twitter, can be used to mobilize individuals to " \
              "engage in climate action. In addition to examining public sentiments about climate change, " \
              "research has also explored the relationship between climate change beliefs and behaviors. For example, " \
              "(Xu & Han, 2019) found that individuals who were more concerned about climate change were more likely " \
              "to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, such as reducing energy consumption and supporting " \
              "environmentally friendly policies. Using two major hurricanes, Hurricane Harvey (2017) and Hurricane " \
              "Dorian (2019), as a lens, this present study provides insight into the dynamic patterns of social " \
              "responses to either hurricane events and climate change by leveraging big data provided by Twitter. " \
              "Despite a rapidly growing body of research using social media to understand the public response to " \
              "natural hazards, this study offers two novelties to the existing literature. First, unlike most " \
              "earlier studies that focused on one single event (Liu et al., 2018, Yuan et al., 2020, Yuan et al., " \
              "2021), this study compares public response to two distinctive hurricane events in the southeastern " \
              "U.S. This comparative approach aims to reveal similarities and differences. Similar patterns suggest " \
              "the common public response regardless of the event. This generalization of knowledge can provide " \
              "directions for future studies and better inform crisis management. Karimiziarani et al., (2022) used " \
              "Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a set of statistical approaches to analyze textual data posted " \
              "on Twitter drung Hurricane Harvey and classified the tweet contents at the county scale. "

              "resistance9,22, 23, 24. Among them, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could bypass HER2 blockage in a " \
              "large number of HER2-positive BCa patients to maintain constant activation25, 26, 27, 28. It is known " \
              "that phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a tumor suppressor gene that is usually lost or mutated " \
              "in many cancer types (e.g., prostate, lung and breast cancer), can negatively regulate the PI3K/Akt " \
              "signaling pathway29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Therefore, blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via " \
              "up-regulating PTEN expression could be considered as an effective strategy to reverse trastuzumab " \
              "resistance and accomplish effective BCa therapy. In recent years, synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) has " \
              "been emerging as a therapeutic for a variety of applications, including vaccine and cancer therapy34, " \
              "35, 36, 37. The recent advancement in mRNA-based therapeutics is the mRNA-1273, a vaccine for " \
              "coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) developed by the Moderna Therapeutics38. Unlike plasmid DNA that " \
              "shows the potential risk of genomic integration and mutagenesis39, mRNA does not insert into the " \
              "genome and can directly translate into protein in the cytoplasm with higher transfection efficiency40, " \
              "41, 42. However, mRNA is a negatively charged biomacromolecule, and therefore requires specific " \
              "delivery vehicles to promote its cytosolic delivery. In the past decade, various nanoparticles (NPs) " \
              "have been widely developed as mRNA delivery carriers42, 43, 44, 45. For example, Shi group recently " \
              "rationally designed and developed lipid/polymer hybrid NPs that could efficiently transport mRNA into " \
              "tumor tissues and significantly up-regulate the expression of tumor suppressors (PTEN and P53) in " \
              "tumor cells32,33,45. The main principle for designing mRNA delivery NPs is to use poly (ethylene " \
              "glycol) (PEG) as outer layer because PEG could impair the nonspecific interaction of NPs with serum " \
              "components46. Unfortunately, this PEGylation could simultaneously impair cellular uptake and thus " \
              "weaken therapeutic effect47. In recent years, arising from the distinguishing microenvironment (e.g., " \
              "weakly acidic pH and hypoxia) in solid tumors, more researches are carried out to develop tumor " \
              "microenvironment (TME)-responsive NPs, which could respond to a TME signal and significantly improve " \
              "the cellular uptake of loaded cargo48, 49, 50. For example, based on the hypoxia-responsive " \
              "characteristic of azobenzene (Azo) or TME pH-responsive characteristic of 2,3-dimethylmaleamidic acid " \
              "(DMA), Azo- or DMA-linked polymers have been elaborately designed and synthesized to construct " \
              "hypoxia- or TME pH-responsive NPs as the delivery carriers of chemotherapeutic drugs and siRNA51, 52, " \
              "53. Despite showing the advantages aforementioned, limited efforts have been made to develop effective " \
              "TME-responsive nanoplatform for systemic mRNA delivery and cancer therapy. We herein developed a new " \
              "TME pH-responsive mRNA delivery nanoplatform for reversal of trastuzumab resistance and effective BCa " \
              "therapy. This nanoplatform comprises of a copolymer methoxyl-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (" \

              "[57], [58], but, in any case, the problems of stability and traversability of the structures have to " \
              "be considered. In other words, the issue is if the problem of the violation of energy conditions by " \
              "standard fluid matter can be overcome by considering geometric structures related to the further " \
              "degrees of freedom besides of them of GR. In [59], [60], energy conditions are discussed in extended " \
              "theories of gravity showing that possible violations, related to standard matter fluids, " \
              "can be restored considering all the contributions to the effective stress-energy tensor acting as " \
              "source in the field equations. For the consistency of wormholes, this means that viable solutions can " \
              "be achieved without searching for exotic matter but considering geometric corrections [41]. After a " \
              "rapid inspection of literature, it is easy to conclude that there are many possibilities to realize " \
              "wormholes without considering exotic matter which, at the moment, is not experimentally probed due to " \
              "no final result on the existence of further particles over the Standard Model. With this status of " \
              "art, it seems reliable to consider the standard observed matter and search for solutions where " \
              "geometric corrections can have a main role. It is worth noticing that effective corrections " \
              "implemented for defining modified or extended theories of gravity can consist of local fields (see " \
              "e.g. [9], [61], [62]). Hence, these corrections are realized through local actions. However, " \
              "any theory of physics should be formulated at non-local level to be in agreement with prescriptions of " \
              "quantum mechanics [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69]. In particular, at the one-loop level, " \
              "a dynamical non-locality emerges from the effective actions of all fundamental interactions [70]. In " \
              "this framework, the non-local theories of gravity have been taken into account to describe the " \
              "gravitational interactions towards a final formulation of quantum gravity [71]. These theories can be " \
              "divided into two main classes. Infinite derivative theories of gravity (IDGs) [72], [73] and integral " \
              "kernel theories of gravity (IKGs) [74], [75], [76], [77], [78]. See [79], [80] for a discussion. The " \
              "main features emerging in adopting non-local corrections in the gravitational action are the " \
              "possibility to regularize and renormalize the theory at UV scales [71], the possibility to achieve " \
              "accelerated cosmic expansion at IR scales [74], [79], [81], and, finally, the emergence of " \
              "characteristic lengths, related to the auxiliary scalar fields, which could be useful to address " \

              "conservative views towards homosexuality compared to the ethnic majority population in Western Europe " \
              "(Röder, 2015, Soehl, 2017). These cultural differences are also found among younger generations: in " \
              "her study in England, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Germany, Kogan (2018) finds that the attitudes " \
              "towards homosexuality of ethnic minority youth from the Middle East, Northern Africa and South Asia " \
              "are much more conservative compared to their ethnic majority counterparts. Similarly, studies on " \
              "sexual prejudice among youth in Belgium find that non-Western ethnic minorities hold considerably more " \
              "conservative attitudes towards homosexuality compared to their ethnic majority peers (Roggemans, " \
              "Spruyt, Van Droogenbroeck, & Keppens, 2015, Teney and Subramanian, 2010). As is argued by Inglehart " \
              "and Norris (2003), how a society views homosexuality speaks volumes about its commitment to equality. " \
              "The more intolerant attitudes towards homosexuality of migrants from conservative countries challenge " \
              "the principle of tolerance and egalitarianism that Western-European societies strive to uphold. " \
              "Therefore, understanding what factors shape attitudes towards homosexuality of ethnic minorities in " \

              "anchored in Western-European legislation (Gerhards, 2010). In line with classic assimilation theory (" \
              "Gordon, 1964), previous studies find that the difference in the level of approval of homosexuality " \
              "between ethnic groups decreases over time (e.g. Röder, 2015; Soehl, 2017). Most of these studies, " \
              "however, focus only on changes that occur for the adult ethnic minority and majority population. " \
              "Instead, in this study we focus on changes that occur for ethnic majority and minority youth. As " \
              "adolescence marks a period in which cultural values are especially susceptible to social influence (" \
              "Krosnick & Alwin, 1989), studying the socializing context at this life phase can increase our " \
              "understanding of the mechanisms underlying cultural assimilation. In particular, we examine the " \
              "influence of a potentially important socializing context that is often overlooked in studies on " \
              "cultural assimilation, namely that of classroom peers (Ali & Fokkema, 2015). The classroom is a unique " \
              "socializing context: in almost no other situation are individuals required to be in direct contact " \
              "with others for such a long period of time (Jackson, 1990). On top of this, classroom socialization " \
              "occurs in a phase of individual’s lives when peer relations are especially intense and important (" \
              "Brechwald & Prinstein, 2011). Consequently, the attitudes of classroom peers has been found to play an " \
              "important role in the development of cultural values in adolescence, such as attitudes towards " \
              "homosexuality (Poteat, 2007, Poteat and Spanierman, 2010). This article examines the role of ethnic " \
              "classroom composition in the development of attitudes towards homosexuality among ethnic majority and " \
              "ethnic minority youth. We use wave 1 and 3 of the Children of Immigrant Longitudinal Survey in Four " \

              "conservation of off-peak power, waste heat and intermittent energy sources, cleverly exploiting clean " \
              "energy resources and decreasing energy consumption [1,2]. An efficient, attractive and innovative " \
              "method of storing thermal energy storage is latent heat storage. Then, the so-called phase change " \
              "materials (PCMs) use the latent heat of the phase transition to quickly store and release a large " \
              "amount of energy during the phase changing process, at a constant temperature [3,4]. Thus, " \
              "PCMs have recently received considerable attention as they substantially contribute to harvest cheap " \
              "and clean energy from waste heat sources and solar energy, for direct uses or converting to " \
              "electricity [5,6]. In addition, they also present the potential for effective heat management in " \
              "various applications such as building, industry or electronic devices [7]. Furthermore, PCMs can be " \
              "added to conventional heat transfer fluids (HTFs), obtaining latent functionally thermal fluids that " \
              "exhibit a higher specific heat storage capacity than conventional HTFs. Therefore, they show promising " \
              "applications in many fields of renewable energy conversion, production, and storage since they remain " \
              "in a fluid state throughout the phase change process, allowing for easy pump transportation and " \
              "circulation in the energy storage systems [[8], [9], [10]]. In general, four broad categories are used " \
              "to classify the thermal fluids that work with latent heat: (1) ice slurries, i.e., mixtures of ice " \
              "particles and an aqueous solution; (2) clathrate hydrate slurries (CHSs); (3) microencapsulated PCM " \
              "slurries (MPCMSs), in which the PCM encapsulated into microcapsules and further dispersed into HTFs; " \
              "and (4) phase change material emulsions (PCMEs), which are formed by dispersing PCM droplets into the " \
              "continuous phase, usually water, with the help of the surfactants that reduce the interfacial tension " \
              "between the two phases [11]. The PCMEs, compared with the others PCM systems, show greater potentials " \
              "and present several advantages, including a simple preparation process, negligible thermal resistance, " \
              "good operation stability and low cost, which make them an excellent HTF. Most of the PCME existing " \
              "literature used as novel HTFs are manufactured by incorporating PCMs into water with the aid of " \
              "emulsifiers [[12], [13], [14]]. However, the aim of this work is to develop PCMEs by using two " \
              "non-aqueous phases for thermal energy storage application, of which, to the best of our knowledge, " \
              "little work has been done so far. In the literature, there are some studies of non-aqueous emulsions " \
              "especially for cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications [15,16] and other uses covering " \
              "crystallization processes within emulsified systems, especially in the food industry [17,18]. However, " \
              "there is almost no research concerning non-aqueous PCMEs as latent functionally HTFs. Only recently, " \
              "the authors have begun to study and develop anhydrous PCMEs in previous work [19,20], facing the lack " \
              "of information regarding the availability of suitable surfactants in such systems and pointing out the " \
              "difficulty in developing such systems. In that sense, these previous works noted the importance of a " \
              "good selection of immiscible phases, since a partial compatibility of the phases would mean a loss of " \
              "their energy storage properties. These almost totally unknown non-aqueous phase change emulsions would " \
              "not only present the advantages that slurries bring to heat transfer applications, such as the " \
              "possibility of using the same medium for transport and storage, the high heat transfer rate due to the " \
              "increase of the specific surface area of the PCM or the easy of pumping transportation and circulation " \
              "[9], but also all those related to the use of oily phases, making a difference. Thus, anhydrous PCMEs " \
              "would allow the transport mass and heat in systems where the pressure and temperature conditions are " \
              "more extreme [21], those systems could withstand much higher temperature and pressure peaks than " \
              "current aqueous systems without being degraded. Moreover, they will provide a better long term " \
              "chemical stability. And, additionally, this study of non-aqueous phase change emulsions will lay the " \
              "groundwork for the use of PCME in applications with phase change temperatures above 100 °C, " \
              "offering the advantage of the emulsions to applications where the current water-based dispersions have " \
              "been restricted due to the upper temperature limit. Therefore, this work can be considered as " \
              "preliminary work for the next major challenge, the development of emulsions that can be used in high " \
              "efficient thermal solar collectors (100 °C), industrial heat recovery (<150 °C) [22], and low and " \
              "intermediate temperature solar collection systems (100-250 °C) [23]. Before going any further, " \
              "it is worth noting that emulsion cooling below the disperse phase melting point will lead to droplets " \
              "solidification and, therefore, the formation of a suspension of solid particles. Even though it would " \
              "be more accurate to call them dispersions (being emulsions above the disperse phase melting point and " \
              "suspensions below the crystallization temperature), the term phase change material emulsion (PCME) is " \
              "widely accepted in the literature and will be used throughout this study. In this work, " \
              "novel non-aqueous emulsions prepared with stearic acid and silicone oil were explored for developing " \
              "PCMEs. Stearic acid is a very promising PCM for latent heat storage systems since its variation in " \
              "both melting temperature and latent during repeated heating/cooling cycles in service is negligible " \
              "and, therefore, shows a good thermal reliability as PCM [24,25]. "

               "previously suggested light speed variation as a consequence of stringy interactions of energetic " \
               "photons from GRBs with the D-particle background incorporated in a Liouville-string scenario of " \
               "space–time foam [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The basic idea is that " \
               "the photon, viewed as bosonic open-string state, scatters off the D0-brane space–time defect to form " \
               "an oscillating intermediate string which subsequently decays to emit the outgoing photon wave with a " \
               "time delay of .The velocity of light in the space–time vacuum is therefore deformed at infrared (IR) " \
               "relative to the string scale. We indicate that this brane/string-inspired model can serve as a " \
               "consistent framework to explain the light speed variation as observed from GRBs, in agreement with " \
               "other astrophysical results to date. Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, " \
               "we briefly review the D-brane realization of space–time foam and its effects on photon propagation. " \
               "In Section “Velocity dispersion of light in the D-particle quantum-gravitational foam medium”, " \
               "we give a derivation of the deformed speed of light in this string-inspired model. In Section “An " \
               "explanation for the light speed variation in GRBs and further discussions” we connect observations " \
               "with the theory to provide an explanation for the finding of the speed-of-light variation as observed " \
               "from analyses of Fermi-GRB data. We then show that some complementary results, including those severe " \
               "limits from birefringence, photon decay, etc., can also be explained in this framework. In the last " \
               "section we conclude with some comments on our proposal. A stringy model for space–time foam In this " \
               "section we quickly review the D-brane model of space–time foam and present its physical consequences. " \
               "The intuitive picture of space–time foam goes all the way back to Wheeler [26], who noted that there " \
               "would be highly curved quantum fluctuations with in the space–time continuum, at short time and small " \
               "spatial scales where quantum-gravity effects become relevant.Within a Liouville non-critical string " \
               "approach towards quantum gravity (QG) [16], [17], [18], [19], a stringy analogue of space–time foam " \
               "model was developed in Refs. [20], [21]. In this string-inspired framework, the observable (" \
               "31)-dimensional Universe is described as a compactified D(irichlet)3-brane [27], roaming in a " \
               "higher-dimensional bulk space–time punctured by point-like D0-brane (“D-particle”) defects in the " \
               "context of Type-IA string theory (a T dual of Type-I superstrings [28]). The standard-model matter " \
               "particles, propagating through the brane world, are viewed as (open) string excitations with their " \
               "ends attached on the D3-brane. When the D3-brane Universe moves in the bulk space, the D-particles " \
               "traverse it and interact with the string matter anchored on the D3-brane in a topologically " \
               "non-trivial manner. For an observer living on the brane world, the D-particles “flash” on and off, " \
               "and appear as quantum space–time foam, termed as “D-foam” [24]. "
